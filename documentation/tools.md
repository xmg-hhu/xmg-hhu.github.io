# XMGTOOL

XMGTOOL, packaged with XMG-2, is a utility to compare outputs generated by different metagrammars. It is tipically used for debugging, while extending the grammar, or to compare the outputs of XMG-1 and XMG-2. XMGTOOL helps tracking which classes generate more or less models, or where the entries of the grammar differ. 

First, the command `pickle` transforms the grammar into a format XMGTOOL can handle: `xmgtool pickle grammar_file output_file` will produce the file `output_file` which will allow to analyse the grammar contained in `grammar_file` (produced by XMG).

The command `fstat` compares the numbers of models for each class contained in two grammars. `xmgtool fstat file1 file2` will print all classes for which the number of entries differ for the two grammars contained in `file1` and `file2` (these files must have been produced by the command `pickle`).
    
# Viewers

Grammars generated with XMG can be viewed using the default GUI packaged with XMG, as showed in the introduction. Other options are available to visualize the generated resource, each of them offering support for different types of grammars:

##  The XMG webGUI
An online tool allows to visualize LTAG grammars with semantic frames: [http://xmg.phil.hhu.de/index.php/upload/upload_viewer](http://xmg.phil.hhu.de/index.php/upload/upload_viewer).
The viewer is optimized for Google Chrome. It was tested under Mozilla Firefox, but performance issues appear as the trees grow. The variable highlighting on click is only available on Chrome.  
Please report any bug related to the GUI on the [GitHub tracker](https://github.com/xmg-hhu/xmg-webgui).

### Exporting
The trees and frames showed in the WebGUI can be exported as SVG files or LaTeX code. To be able to compile the exported LaTeX code, the library [avm](https://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/tex/avm-doc.pdf) is necessary. 

##  Pytreeview
Pytreeview is a tree viewer written in Python, for LTAG grammars: [https://gitlab.com/parmenti/pytreeview](https://gitlab.com/parmenti/pytreeview)
    
# Parsers

The resources created with XMG can of course be used for parsing. [TuLiPA](https://sourcesup.cru.fr/tulipa/biblio.html) [[Parmentier et al., 2008](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W08/W08-2316.pdf)] allows to parse LTAG grammars with predicate based semantics. Its new version, [TuLiPA-frames](https://github.com/spetitjean/TuLiPA-frames/) [[Arps and Petitjean, 2018](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2018/pdf/567.pdf)] provides a parser for LTAG with frame semantics.
